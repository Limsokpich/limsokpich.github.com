        <p>
            My final project is Pokemond Battle, it is a continution from Game On! but with swist. Pokemond Battle is a two player game where the first to reach 15 points win. Each player takes turn "throwing" a pokeball and a random pokemon will show up; depending on the pokemon the player either gain plus or minus points.

        <h3 class="cp1">User Testing Results</h3>
        <p>
            3 Significant Findings:
            <ul>
                <li class="l1">User Input Page:
                    <ul>
                        Throughtout the three trials I ran, only some of my users thougth that the instruction font color was a little difficult to read, especially with the image in the background. One user suggessted that I could move the image to be behind the player's name input box instead. 
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <img src="images/img5.png" alt="user_input_page">

                <li class="l2">Game Play:
                    <ul>
                        One main observation was that users were confused as to which side they should play on and who would start first. It was not clear on who would start playing first and which side of split screen they should click. One user started clicking on the wrong side of the split screen. Although the users did figure it out, there needed to be some guidence and clarifications as to who wouls start playing first.  
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <img src="images/img4.png" alt="game_play">

                <li class="l3">Game Play User Feedback: 
                    <ul>
                        Users had trouble with being able to see the points being add or subtracted based on the pokemon they threw. The feedback from when the user clicks the throw button was not visiable making them question what happened when they click a throw button. 
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <img src="images/img2.png" alt="game_play_with_fadebox">
            </ul>
        </p>
    </article>

    <article class="a1">
        <h3 class="cp1">Feedback Interventions</h3>
        <p>After the user testing feedback these are a list of redesigns I plan to make changes to:</p>
        <ul class="fblist">
            <li>Possiblly change the background color during the hover state at play button.</li>
            <li>Maybe move the iamge on the instruction page to behind the player's name input box.</li>
            <li>Possiblly change the color of the instruction if not the previously listed. </li>
            <li>Set the fade bax right at the beginning of the game so players can figure out who plays first.</li>
            <li>Update the graphics so that there is some sort of animations during when the users clicks on the throw button.</li>
            <li>Finally, update the turn message or just get rid of it for all.</li>
        </ul>
