            <p class="intro">
                What is a modal, overlay, or dialog window? A modal window is is an element that sits on top of an 
                application’s main window. It creates a mode that disables the main window but keeps it visible 
                with the modal window as a child window in front of it. Users must interact with the modal window 
                before they can return to the parent application. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="keypoints">
                When do we want to use this UI design pattern for: <br> <br>
                1. Grabbing the user's attention <br>
                2. Needing users input <br>
                3. Showing additional information <br>
            </p>

            <h3>Breakdown of the Modal Window:</h3>

            <p class="p1">
                In every modal it is important to include an escape button for users to exit out of the overlay view. These 
                could be a cancel button, "x" button, enabling the escape key or clicking out of the window. 
            </p>

            <p class="p2">
                The second thing is to include a descriptive title or tag at the top of the modal window. This informs users 
                where they are at and what the purpose of the overlay window is. It also helps to let users know why they 
                are seeing this window page. 
            </p>

            <p class="p3">
                Finally, is to practice the design, sizing, and placing the modal window in meaning location. A good rule to 
                use is to keep the window in the upper half of the screen because in mobile view modal may be lost if placed 
                lower and don’t use more than 50% of the screen for the overlay. Making sure your design the color or opacity 
                of the window so that your focus is on the overlay by making sure to blur or darken out any background content. 
            </p>

            <p class="intro">
                Some of the reasons why users don't continue or stay on a webpage for long is because the information they 
                receive is too long and overwhelming. In modern times, people move in a quick pace timeline so no one is 
                going to go care in the depth of filling out a form especially online unless they have to. In the article 
                "Best Practices for Form Design" by Salim Asari, the four key aspects I got from understanding designing 
                form webpages are: 
            </p>
    
            <p class="keypoints"> 
                1. Minimizing Input Feilds<br>
                2. Include a Multi-Step Loader or Progress Bar<br>
                3. Only Design Short and Easy to Understand Questions<br>
                4. Never Design a Reset or Clear Button <br>
            </p>
    
            <h3>1. Minimizing Input Feilds <br> </h3>

            <p class="p1">
                Lots of time web designers mistakingly design form pages that are too long and include too much information 
                for users to fill out. This is one of the highest reasons why users quit or give up on the webpage before 
                actually clicking the submit or finish button. The best thing to do design is to include minimal questions 
                and fill our form so it encourages users' completion. <br>
            </p>
                    
            <h3>2. Including a Progress Bar <br> </h3>
    
            <p class="p2">
                When it comes to having users fill out loads of information it is important to create a progress bar so 
                that users have a visual idea of how long the process is and where they are at in filling out the information. <br> 
            </p>
                    
            <h3>3. Only Design Short and Easy to Understand questions <br> </h3>

            <p class="p3">
                It's important to always ask easy questions for users to get familiar and feel less overwhelmed by the form. 
                Distinguishing optional and required fields are important. The design aspect of the website should be easy for 
                the eye of the users to navigate. This includes elements like label positions and place holder text. Action 
                buttons and feedback response is good for getting the user to move on or gesture them to take further action. <br>
            </p>
                  
            <h3>4. Never Design a Reset or Clear Button <br> </h3>

            <p class="p4">
                In short, there are more drawbacks than benefits to this design. If a designer enables that button, users could 
                accidentally click on it and all of their work would be gone, thus, discouraging them to not want to complete 
                the form again.
