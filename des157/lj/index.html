                Some of the reasons why users don't continue or stay on a webpage for long is because the information they 
            receive is too long and overwhelming. In modern times, people move in a quick pace timeline so no one is 
            going to go care in the depth of filling out a form especially online unless they have to. In the article 
            "Best Practices for Form Design" by Salim Asari, the four key aspects I got from understanding designing 
            form webpages are: 
            </p>
    
            <p class="keypoints"> 
                1. Minimizing Input Feilds<br>
                2. Include a Multi-Step Loader or Progress Bar<br>
                3. Only Design Short and Easy to Understand Questions<br>
                4. Never Design a Reset or Clear Button <br>
            </p>
    
            <h3>1. Minimizing Input Feilds <br> </h3>

            <p class="p1">
                Lots of time web designers mistakingly design form pages that are too long and include too much information 
            for users to fill out. This is one of the highest reasons why users quit or give up on the webpage before 
            actually clicking the submit or finish button. The best thing to do design is to include minimal questions 
            and fill our form so it encourages users' completion. <br>
            </p>
                    
            <h3>2. Including a Progress Bar <br> </h3>
    
            <p class="p2">
                When it comes to having users fill out loads of information it is important to create a progress bar so 
            that users have a visual idea of how long the process is and where they are at in filling out the information. <br> 
            </p>
                    
            <h3>3. Only Design Short and Easy to Understand questions <br> </h3>

            <p class="p3">
                It's important to always ask easy questions for users to get familiar and feel less overwhelmed by the form. 
            Distinguishing optional and required fields are important. The design aspect of the website should be easy for 
            the eye of the users to navigate. This includes elements like label positions and place holder text. Action 
            buttons and feedback response is good for getting the user to move on or gesture them to take further action. <br>
            </p>
                  
            <h3>4. Never Design a Reset or Clear Button <br> </h3>

            <p class="p4">
                In short, there are more drawbacks than benefits to this design. If a designer enables that button, users could 
            accidentally click on it and all of their work would be gone, thus, discouraging them to not want to complete 
            the form again.
