                    <p class="intro">
                        As a person who always loves to play games since young, I was really excited to read "Game Design UX Best Practice" written by Amir Dori. It was good information to read about the comfort-to-reach and hard-to-reach ideas in UI designing. It was a good thing that I've heard about this concept before so it was great to read about it in an actual article. Some of the concepts I comprehended from reading the article are the strategic placement of slides, pop-ups, and user choice, and awarded videos in game design. First, sliders are great at providing users with more information and choices about the game without them navigating away from the main screen. A great tip is to show partially in the screen that there is more content for users to scroll on the slider. Second, pop-ups are great at delivering information to users at a quick moment in time. Including animations for when the user clicks on the pop-up button is a great feedback user experience. Also, make sure that the background fades from when the pop-up occurs is a great design method to show a focus on a certain view, and avoiding the "x" design enables the user to not click away from the content. Third, users' choice via pop-ups is a must in pop-ups when you have that design in a game. Most great user choices have button placement on the right side of the pop-up while bad user choice designs have button placement on the left side. It all goes back to the comfort-to-reach and hard-to-reach concept of game design. Finally, awarded videos encourage the user to want to keep playing when there is something in it for them. Unlocking and gaining awards enables the user to keep engaged and active with the game because it gives them something to look for.

                    <p class="p1">
                        This image is interesting because in the process of make this I thought a lot about how to 
                        express the image so the interpreter can see however they want too. I idea of the painting is to 
                        express a mysterious person that is why there isn’t an actual face painted on the canvas. It’s 
                        also difficult to tell if the person is a female or male which makes the whole painting. I wanted 
                        it to be genderless and unconventional to gender norms. This relates to my collection because I 
                        really like painting anything and everything I feel during the moment I paint them. In the 
                        collection I plan to use on my website is supposedly to express a sense of emotion of freedom and 
                        mystery much. The collection really express and connects to me in a way that sometimes I don’t know 
                        about my future and the mystery of who I will be. How I wish there was a way to escape or get away 
                        from all the hectic norms of society.

                    <p class="p1">
                        From my understanding this image is of a Peruvian doll based on the Peruvian collection my group, 
                        Diego, plan to present on his website. One interesting thing about this image is that it reminds 
                        me of how the doll express the traditions of Peruvians children. As a kid I’ve always wanted to 
                        have a doll but I couldn’t afford one so the symbols of dolls really express so much of a tradition, 
                        cultures, and people that made the dolls. The most obvious aspect of this image where you would find 
                        the doll or what region of country this doll is from. You could see the tradition of where they came 
                        from. The most mysterious aspect of this image what story does this doll tell? Sometimes dolls 
                        really scare me and there is always some sort of story that goes along with a doll/toy figure.

                    <p class="intro">
                        What kind of information strikes your interests? People are always so quick to move on from everything they do. We never really 
                        analyze the kinds of information we hear or see unless it strikes our interests. So when and how should we pay attention to 
                        this kind of detail? After reading "10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills" and examining 
                        "The Boat" website I've come to this analysis. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="p1">
                        The first interaction as I opened up the website had already caught my attention. This is the most important idea because people 
                        only have so much attention span. Being able to make people go "huh" or "what" makes them want to analyze it because it has some 
                        sort of meaning to them to want to understand. It really does make you ask questions like "What’s going on in this picture? What 
                        do you see that makes you say that? What more can you find?" These questions guide users to want to interact with the website
                        and want to read more. In addition to it being very captivating, the interactive made the visual image on the website even more 
                        interesting. In "The Boat" website, there is a moment where the user scroll and the images and text in the website would slant or 
                        sway like it is on a boat. The drawing on the website really makes the user look closely and analyze why they chose to draw it 
                        that way or when they decided to color the image that way. 
                    </p>
            
                    <p class="p2">
                        Overall this website was built very beautifully. There were many times for users to interact and examine the images and draw on 
                        the website. The narration guided users visually and physically. Here is a link to the <a href="http://www.sbs.com.au/theboat/">website</a>

                        <h2>By Limsokpich Sung, January 27th, 2021</h2>

                    <p class="intro">
                        What is a modal, overlay, or dialog window? A modal window is is an element that sits on top of an 
                        application’s main window. It creates a mode that disables the main window but keeps it visible 
                        with the modal window as a child window in front of it. Users must interact with the modal window 
                        before they can return to the parent application. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="keypoints">
                        When do we want to use this UI design pattern for: <br>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Grabbing the user's attention<br></li>
                            <li>Needing users input<br></li>
                            <li>Showing additional information<br></li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Breakdown of the Modal Window:</h3>

                    <p class="p1">
                        In every modal it is important to include an escape button for users to exit out of the overlay view. These 
                        could be a cancel button, "x" button, enabling the escape key or clicking out of the window. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="p2">
                        The second thing is to include a descriptive title or tag at the top of the modal window. This informs users 
                        where they are at and what the purpose of the overlay window is. It also helps to let users know why they 
                        are seeing this window page. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="p3">
                        Finally, is to practice the design, sizing, and placing the modal window in meaning location. A good rule to 
                        use is to keep the window in the upper half of the screen because in mobile view modal may be lost if placed 
                        lower and don’t use more than 50% of the screen for the overlay. Making sure your design the color or opacity 
                        of the window so that your focus is on the overlay by making sure to blur or darken out any background content. 
                    </p>

                <!--Jounral 1: Body-->
                <p class="intro">
                    Some of the reasons why users don't continue or stay on a webpage for long is because the information they 
                    receive is too long and overwhelming. In modern times, people move in a quick pace timeline so no one is 
                    going to go care in the depth of filling out a form especially online unless they have to. In the article 
                    "Best Practices for Form Design" by Salim Asari, the four key aspects I got from understanding designing 
                    form webpages are: 
                </p>
        
                <p class="keypoints"> 
                    <ol>
                        <li>Minimizing Input Feilds<br></li>
                        <li>Include a Multi-Step Loader or Progress Bar<br></li>
                        <li>Only Design Short and Easy to Understand Questions<br></li>
                        <li>Never Design a Reset or Clear Button <br></li>    
                    </ol>
                </p>
        
                <h3>1. Minimizing Input Feilds <br> </h3>

                <p class="p1">
                    Lots of time web designers mistakingly design form pages that are too long and include too much information 
                    for users to fill out. This is one of the highest reasons why users quit or give up on the webpage before 
                    actually clicking the submit or finish button. The best thing to do design is to include minimal questions 
                    and fill our form so it encourages users' completion. <br>
                </p>
                        
                <h3>2. Including a Progress Bar <br> </h3>
        
                <p class="p2">
                    When it comes to having users fill out loads of information it is important to create a progress bar so 
                    that users have a visual idea of how long the process is and where they are at in filling out the information. <br> 
                </p>
                        
                <h3>3. Only Design Short and Easy to Understand questions <br> </h3>

                <p class="p3">
                    It's important to always ask easy questions for users to get familiar and feel less overwhelmed by the form. 
                    Distinguishing optional and required fields are important. The design aspect of the website should be easy for 
                    the eye of the users to navigate. This includes elements like label positions and place holder text. Action 
                    buttons and feedback response is good for getting the user to move on or gesture them to take further action. <br>
                </p>
                    
                <h3>4. Never Design a Reset or Clear Button <br> </h3>

                <p class="p4">
                    In short, there are more drawbacks than benefits to this design. If a designer enables that button, users could 
                    accidentally click on it and all of their work would be gone, thus, discouraging them to not want to complete 
                    the form again.
